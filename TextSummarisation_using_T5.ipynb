The blazing sun had made it incredibly thirsty, and its wings felt heavy from flying for so long. After a long search, it saw a small village. The crow flew towards the village and saw a pot in a courtyard. It was so excited, but when it looked inside, it saw only a tiny bit of water at the bottom. The crow didn't give up. It had a smart idea. It started picking up small stones and dropping them into the pot, one by one. As it dropped more stones, the water level slowly rose. Finally, after a lot of hard work, the crow could drink the water. It was so happy and flew away, leaving behind a lesson for everyone. The lesson was about not giving up and finding clever ways to solve problems, just like the crow did. The people in the village were amazed by the clever crow and never forgot the story of the thirsty crow. \"\"\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer.encode(\"sumarize : \" + input_text, return_tensors = 'pt' , max_length = 1000 , truncation = True)\n","output = model_1.generate(input_ids, max_length = 250, num_beams = 5 , length_penalty= 4.0 , early_stopping = False )\n","summary = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens=True)\n","print(\" \")\n","print(\"Generated Summary \", summary)"],"metadata":{"id":"yz-jmsUQWRec","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693744081890,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":30306,"user":{"displayName":"Vansh Julka","userId":"04525971208789675291"}},"outputId":"6932aaef-20fc-497f-a7c8-36333dc60ca3"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>.
