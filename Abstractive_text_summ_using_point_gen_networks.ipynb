The blazing sun had made it incredibly thirsty, and its wings felt heavy from flying for so long. After a long search, it saw a small village. The crow flew towards the village and saw a pot in a courtyard. It was so excited, but when it looked inside, it saw only a tiny bit of water at the bottom. The crow didn't give up. It had a smart idea. It started picking up small stones and dropping them into the pot, one by one. As it dropped more stones, the water level slowly rose. Finally, after a lot of hard work, the crow could drink the water. It was so happy and flew away, leaving behind a lesson for everyone. The lesson was about not giving up and finding clever ways to solve problems, just like the crow did. The people in the village were amazed by the clever crow and never forgot the story of the thirsty crow. \"\"\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer.encode(\"sumarize : \" + input_text, return_tensors = 'pt' , max_length = 1000 , truncation = True)\n","output = model_1.generate(input_ids, max_length = 150, num_beams = 7 , length_penalty= 2.0 , early_stopping = True )\n","summary = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens=True)\n","print(\" \")\n","print(\"Generated Summary \", summary)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ufpE6DtYGiRt","outputId":"f8284878-4933-4f14-ec8e-be07a7c86529","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693739738394,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":160732,"user":{"displayName":"Vansh Julka","userId":"04525971208789675291"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Input Batch Shape: torch.Size([1, 283])\n","Output Batch Shape: torch.Size([1, 63])\n","Hidden States Shape: torch.Size([32100])\n","Epoch 1/50, Loss: 2764.97607421875\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/nn/modules/loss.py:101: UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([1, 63])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([1, 1])).

With the blazing sun beating down on it, the bird scoured the parched landscape for signs of relief. After what felt like an eternity, it stumbled upon a quaint earthenware pot in the courtyard of a humble village house. Hope turned to disappointment as the crow found only a meager trickle of water at the pot's bottom, far from sufficient to quench its thirst. Yet, the crow refused to yield to despair. Instead, it hatched a clever plan, using its beak to drop small pebbles into the pot, one by one. As each pebble fell, the water level in the pot slowly crept higher. The crow's tenacity knew no bounds, and after relentless effort, the water reached a level where it could drink. With a grateful heart, the crow finally quenched its long-standing thirst.
